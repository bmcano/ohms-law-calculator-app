    <string name="learn_intro_body">"Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering and physics that describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit. It states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor."</string>
